        <h1> $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance in algebraic geometry</h1>
        <p>Our main goal in this seminar is to understand $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy of schemes and to compare the situation with that of topology. To this end, we will prove the analogues of two well-known results in topology:<br>
<ol>
  <li>If $X$ is a smooth affine scheme, then there is a bijection between rank $n$ vector bundles over $X$ and $\mathbb{A}^1$-homotopy classes of maps $X\to \mathrm{Gr}_n$.</li>
  <li>Vector bundles over $R[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ are in bijection with vector bundles over $R$, for $R$ essentially finite type regular $k$-algebra.</li>
</ol>

One may view the first result as analogue of the universal property of Grassmannian in topology. Whereas, the second result is the analogue of triviality of vector bundles over contractible spaces (like $\mathbb{R}^n$). Both these facts tells us that there is an inherent relation of homotopy for schemes. Further evidence for this also appears from various other cohomology theories for schemes, like the $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance of $K$-theory, etale cohomology and Chow rings. We will explore them around the end.
